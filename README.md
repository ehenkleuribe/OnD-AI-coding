**Add local AI coding to your professional toolkit.**  
Generate PowerShell scripts, troubleshoot systems, document infrastructure—all without sending data to the cloud.

## Why This Matters

You're an IT professional—support, network, infrastructure, maybe development. You have deep expertise in your domain. This guide helps you add a new capability: running powerful AI models locally for daily work. Generate automation scripts, troubleshoot error messages, write documentation. Practical tasks that justify the setup time.

**What makes this different:** No cloud dependencies, no data leaving your organization, no monthly subscriptions. Your hardware, your models, your data.

---

## What This Covers

This documentation covers a specific starting-point stack for 32GB Windows 11 systems — an **inference engine** (to run models locally), a **local open-weights model**, and a **coding interface** (to connect your IDE to the running model).

The [technical documentation](SETUP.md) uses a concrete example stack so instructions are copy-paste ready. The [findings](findings/README.md) reflect what participants actually validated across different hardware and tooling combinations — including alternatives to the example stack.

> **16GB systems:** See sidebars throughout the documentation for smaller model alternatives that work within tighter memory constraints.

## 🏗 How It Fits Together

    A[You] -->|Commands| B[opencode]

    style C fill:#0078D4,color:#fff
    style D fill:#00ADD8,color:#fff
```

**Key constraints for 32GB:**
- **Context:** 32,768 tokens
- **Concurrency:** 1 request at a time  
- **Single model:** Unload before loading another (RAM physics, not ceremony)

These are tested defaults that keep everything stable when running other software alongside your AI tools.

## ⚡ Quick Start

<img src="assets/Droid.png" alt="Automation assistant icon" width="80" align="right"/>

Are you familiar with local AI setup already? Then you can use these three commands to get running:

```powershell
# Install LM Studio
winget install ElementLabs.LMStudio --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements

# Download and start
lms get <model-name>
lms load <model-name> --context-length 32768 --parallel-requests 1
```

DO you need step-by-step guidance? Then follow [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for the complete setup sequence.

## Who This Serves

**Primary:** Field IT Pros learning to add AI coding to their toolkit. You might not have touched git or developer workflows before—that's fine. We explain what matters without assuming developer background.

**Also useful for:** Developers (who already know opencode), Infrastructure Architects, Software Architects, Specialists/SMEs, IT Team Managers.

If you're a professional looking to expand your capabilities with practical AI tools, this documentation is for you.
